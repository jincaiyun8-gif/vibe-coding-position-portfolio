                    <p>Over the past weeks in Vibe Coding, my understanding of AI as a creative partner has shifted from fascination and convenience to a much more complex stance of <strong>critical optimism</strong>. My early expectation was that AI might "fill in the gaps" of my technical skills and help me actualize ideas that previously felt out of reach.</p>

                    <p>While this did happen, I also learned that <strong>AI is not a neutral co-creator</strong>—it amplifies clarity when my intentions are strong, and exposes vagueness when I don't yet know what I truly want.</p>

                    <p>Through making four projects—<em>Teahouse of Balance</em>, <em>Nutrition Snap</em>, <em>Light Runner</em>, and <em>Oracle 9</em>—I now believe that:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        AI is a powerful collaborator for expansion, but an unreliable partner for intuition. It can turn concepts into visual or functional prototypes with extraordinary speed, but it cannot sense atmosphere, intention, cultural depth, or emotional meaning unless I articulate those elements explicitly.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>In other words, <strong>AI magnifies human creativity but cannot substitute for it.</strong></p>

                    <p>This position resonates with Weizenbaum's reminder that users often project understanding and meaning onto machines, even when the machine itself possesses none. Across my projects, I repeatedly confronted this illusion: the more I assumed AI "knew what I meant," the more it returned outputs that felt hollow or misaligned.</p>
                    <p>This tension—between my imagination and the system's pattern-based generation—became the core of my learning.</p>

                    <p>In this project, I developed the conceptual theme first: a space of balance, harmony, and calm. When I shared this with AI, the system was able to turn my loose abstractions into something concrete—rich visuals, detailed descriptions, and interface ideas.</p>

                    <p>What surprised me was how <strong>empowering</strong> this felt. AI made me realize that someone without coding expertise can still create websites, apps, and interactions. Yet at the same time, AI lacked the emotional intuition I associated with "balance."</p>
                    <p>I had to be precise about tone, light, movement, and mood; otherwise, the outputs felt generic. This was my first understanding that <strong>AI expands creative possibility but depends entirely on the clarity of my intention.</strong></p>

                    <p>This project emerged from a personal need: I'm not good at budgeting or tracking nutrition, and I wanted a tool that could help me visualize my weekly dietary patterns.</p>
                    <p>When I gave AI a prompt, the textual outputs were good—but the visual style was totally wrong. I had imagined a clean, minimal, calming aesthetic, but AI generated bright, cartoonish images that clashed with my vision.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        This taught me that AI is not imaginative on its own—it interpolates between patterns. When my instructions were vague, the system returned the most statistically average aesthetic. When my instructions were specific, it could produce something aligned with my taste.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><strong>This clarified my position: AI doesn't replace human taste—it depends on it.</strong></p>

                    <p>This embodied sensation—my breath tightening, my heartbeat syncing with the tempo—was something AI could not replicate.</p>

                    <p>AI can simulate timing, but it cannot feel timing. It lacks the sense of danger, speed, and embodiment that makes gameplay meaningful.</p>

                    <p>Yet the AI-generated readings were vague, templated, and not at all accurate when tested by my classmates. The system imitated surface aesthetics—fonts, colors, layout—but the spiritual essence felt missing.</p>

                    <h3><span class="step-number">2</span>Norbert Wiener — Automation Cannot Replace Human Purpose</h3>
                    <p>Wiener argued that automated systems excel in logic and efficiency but cannot provide human purpose or meaning.</p>
                    <p>In Light Runner, AI was excellent at helping structure mechanics, but only I as a human could feel danger, rhythm, or joy. <strong>Creativity is embodied; AI is not.</strong></p>

                    <p>AI reproduces templates because it is trained on templates. <strong>True creativity requires context, history, and cultural meaning—none of which AI possesses.</strong></p>

                    <h3><span class="step-number">4</span>Conclusion: My Final Position</h3>
                    <p>I now believe that <strong>AI is a collaborator that expands capacity but cannot deepen meaning</strong>. It helps transform ideas into tangible prototypes, especially for creators without technical skills. Yet AI cannot sense atmosphere, embodiment, cultural nuance, or spiritual intention. Its creativity is derivative, not intuitive.</p>

                    <div class="conclusion-box">
                        <h4>AI is therefore a mirror rather than a muse:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It reveals what I haven't articulated.</li>
                            <li>It amplifies what I express clearly.</li>
                            <li>It collapses into emptiness when I lack clarity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">As I leave Vibe Coding, I hold a stance of <strong>critical optimism</strong>. I am excited to use AI to prototype, visualize, and iterate—but I no longer expect it to provide creative depth. That part remains human.</p>
